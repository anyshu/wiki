== the zen of python ==
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced
----
Beautiful is better than ugly.

Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

— Abelson & Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
== swap ==
a,b = b,a
`这里其实直接就是tuple的赋值过程吧?`

== 列表压缩 ==
...经常使用,跳过

== for else ==
{{{
for i in xx:
    pass
else:
    pass
}}}

We even could implement this use "GOTO" in C, as this is simpler.

{{{
for i in XX:
    if :
        goto FIND;
NOTFIND: // This is redutant, for explicity.
    goto END;
FIND:
    find..
END:
    pass
}}}

== with ==
self-define with expression

== partial ==

== Fluent Interface ==
like Haskell's *->*

{{{
ages = [42, 21, 18, 33, 19]
IterHelper(ages).map(lambda x:x>=18).all()
}}}
