How to compute complexity of a function?

NOTE:
this is not algorithm complexity.

== Cyclomatic Complexity ==
based on brach number in function.

V(G) = e - n + 2

* e     edges number in control flowchart
* n     nodes number in control flowchart

All END nodes as only ONE node, even though not only one return statements or
throw statements.

This V(G) means need number of test cases to cover all branches.

Normal conditon, this CC need less than 10 or 15.
