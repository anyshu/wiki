How to compute complexity of a function?

NOTE:
this is not algorithm complexity.

== Cyclomatic Complexity ==
based on brach number in function.

V(G) = e - n + 2

* e     edges number in control flowchart
* n     nodes number in control flowchart

All END nodes as only ONE node, even though not only one return statements or
throw statements.

This V(G) means need number of test cases to cover all branches.

Normal conditon, this CC need less than 10 or 15.

圈复杂度

用于衡量代码的逻辑分支复杂度.
可以衡量代码质量,更好的衡量代码测试覆盖率,提高代码质量水平.

对于C有工具CppNcss, 还有SourceInsight 的插件 SourceMonitor.
对于Java有工具,JavaNCSS, PMD, CheckStyle等.
对于Python有Mccabe.
