=== 13.4 placing file records on Disk ===

- record and record types
Each record consists of a collection of releated `data values or items`, where each value if formed of one or more bytes and corresponds to a pariticular `filed` of the record.

BLOB Binary Large Objects. pointer to the BLOB is inclued in the record.

- files, fixed-length records, and variable-length records

`In SINA's exam, the last problem if sequencly output large set of numbers. Using fixed-length of data record, we can simply read file as a simple Database to reduce memory.`

# fixed-length field
# variable-length field
# repeating field or repeating group
# optional field
# mixed file, which contains records of different record types.

optional field we could have `every field` included in `every file record`,but store a special null value if no value exists for that field.

For a repeating field, we could allocate as many spaces in each records as the `maximum number of values` that the field can take.

but waste spaces.

`special separator char`

`length`

For optional field, store `<field-name> : <field-value>` to save spaces.

- record blocking and Spanned versus Unspanned records.
