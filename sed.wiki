== raw string ==
when try to replace some string with backslashes, maybe want to use escape
char.

actually, use a different symbol after the s command that doesn't appear in
the text.

for example, use %, then we get.

sed 's%XXX%YYY%g'

just like /.

NOTE:
when use for replace which contain a lost "/", such like path name, it's so
useful.
