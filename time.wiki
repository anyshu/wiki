= Time =
== gettimeofday ==
- wall-time
== clock_gettime ==
- REALTIME      same with gettimeofday
- MONOTONIC     not jump, but can adjust
- MONOTONIC_RAW not jump, not adjust
- BOOTIME       like MONOTONIC, but will continue when system is suspended
- PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID    cpu time, for process
- THREAD_CPUTIME_ID     cpu time, for thread

== time adjust ==
=== date ===
admin can directly change time.

=== NTP ===
When change time, NTP will incremental adjustment time.
{{{
sudo service ntp stop
sudo ntpd -gq
sudo service ntp start
}}}

`ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com`

This will adjust time from ntp server immediately.

== hwclock ==
- --adjust
- --systohc     write system time to hardware clock

=== NITZ ===
Network Identity and Time Zone

local time, time zone and DST offset as well as netowork provider Identity
information, to mobile devices via wireless network.

NITZ is often used to automatically update system clock of mobie phones.

== How to adjust time ==

{{{
# sync with NTP server
ntpdate 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
# double-check time
date
# write to hwclock
sudo hwclock -w
}}}
