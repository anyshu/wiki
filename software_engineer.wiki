this is a new (for 2014) concept.

issue -> branch -> develop <-> PR -> review -> merge -> depoly -> finish

Pros::
* light
* easy to track, logging
* branch is a core concept in Git.

Pratice myself first!

=== Gotchas for now ===
- Submit unit is CL, not branch.
    so we have to merge to one CL. we cannot make a big or full feature, which
    cannot contain in *ONE* CL.

    There is dependency between different CL for one feature, but we cannot
    track them, or separate them. All these leads to regressions and bugs.

    this leading to heavily sumbit, it's hard to review.

- issue to CL/branch not clear
    we have to manualy to follow rules(add link in commit).

    we cannot automatically mark them "finished" or "resolved".

- submit window
    we have submit window to receive CLs, this make our work isolated.

    The cycle between test/verify back to develop is too long. we need quick
    feedback.
