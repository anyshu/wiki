== n-tier arch ==
as a extesion of C/S arch.

C/S arch is 2-tier arch.

This design pattern is based on the concept of breaking a system into
different pieces or tiers that can be physically separated.

- Each tier is responsible for providing a specific functionality.
- A tier only interacts with the tiers adjacent to it through a well-defined
interface.

web 2.0/3.0 need more user to generate content in presentation side, not only
one administrator or one maintainer.

# Presentation tier
# Application (logic) tier
# Data tier

== MVC ==
- presentation logic tier
- business logic tier
- data acess tier
