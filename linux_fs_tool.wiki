== ramdisk/tmpfs ==
Linux is very efficient in using RAM, so not try to using ramdisk to speed up
frequent IO.

try using ramdisk/tmpfs to speed up compiling process, finally failed.

* git GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM, even though work around this by move
ramdisk path to orignal code path.
* ELF binaries not XIP(executable in place), so not executable under ramdisk
* not so fast, not so efficient

- -mount 不跨越文件的挂载点进行查找,在某些情况下,例如不希望检查挂载路径时非常方便
