YUV is colorspace. RGB is other colorspace.

YUV have 3 compotents:
* lumia
* two chrominance

== sample rate ==
* 4:4:4     every pixel have each component of YUV
* 4:2:2     every pixel have each component of Y, and every two pixel (in one
        line, only have one UV component)
* 4:2:0     every piexl have each component of Y, and every four pixel (two
        line, two column, only have one UV component)

== layout ==
* packed, YUV is packed together.
* planar, YUV component save seperatly.
    semi-planar, Y and UV component save seperatly
* tile, group as block (such as 6*6 pixel), then ...

== bit depth ==
* 8 bit, This is general situation.
* 10 bit
* 16 bit

== range ==
* Y is unsigned, [0,1) or [0,255]
* UV is singed, [-0.5,0.5) or [-127, 128]

so when UV is 0x80, then color is gray.
- 0x00 00 00,   green
- 0xff ff ff,   pink

This is very different with RGB colorspace.

== alignment ==
memory may have width alignment, even height alignment

== tile ==
directly layout pixel in memory.

This style have good cache performance when access pixel from left to right,
then top to bottom.

However, when access pixels from top to bottom, then left to right, will get
many cache misses.

When switch to tiled mode or wizzle mode, it have balance on cache access.

This style is better for graphics application.
