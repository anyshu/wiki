== A* ==
`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`

- g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to `n`.
- h(n) is heuristic that estimates the cost of the cheapest path from n to
the goal.

heuristic function must be `admissible`.
it never overestimates the actual cost to get to the nearest goal node.

If h(n) is monotone, A* is more efficiently.

Typical implement of A* use a `priority queue` (ref:[[struct]]) to perform the
repeated selection of minimum (estimated) cost nodes to expand.
