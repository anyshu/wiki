= how to send mail from the linux command line =

*mail -s [SUBJECT] [TOaddrlist]*

mail body from _STDIN_ or using _echo_ command

== OPTION ==
- -s    SUBJECT
- comma delimiter in TOADDR
- -a    append other header scope
NOTE:
may have some issues.
- -c    CC to addr
- -b    BCC to addr

=== append option ===
* -aFrom:liuyang\<liuyang@test.com\>            sender
* --append "Cc: abc@123.com"                    CC
* --append "Content-Type: text/html"            send html format mail

== THEORY ==
install `mailutils`

mail command -> /usr/sbin/sendmail -> local MTA(smtp server) -> recipient
MTA(and InBox)

NOTE: this method, need local server work as MTA.

this is different with python smtp library, which need login to remote server,
     then send mail.

- the sender is current user at your server's hostname.
- when the TOAddrLst is without host name, it will default to current server's
user.

== attachment ==
uuencode / uudecode

`uuecode [FILENAME] [name] | mail ...`

`uuencode [-m] [ file ] name`

transmit binary file to a channel which only for ascii pure text.

`(cat mailtext; uuencode [filename] [name]) | mail ...`

== too slow ==
move this
`127.0.1.1	HOSTNAME`

to
`127.0.1.1	HOSTNAME.localdomain HOSTNAME`
