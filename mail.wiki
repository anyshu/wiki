= how to send mail from the linux command line =

*mail -s [SUBJECT] [TOaddrlist]*

mail body from _STDIN_ or using _echo_ command

== OPTION ==
- -s    SUBJECT
- -c    CC to addr
- -b    BCC to addr
- comma delimiter in TOADDR
- -a    append other header scope
-aFrom:liuyang\<liuyang@test.com\>

== THEORY ==
install mailutils

mail command -> /usr/sbin/sendmail -> local MTA(smtp server) -> recipient
MTA(and InBox)

NOTE: this method, need local server work as MTA.

this is different with python smtp library, which need login to remote server,
     then send mail.

- the sender is current user at your server's hostname.
- the TOAddrLst without server, will default to current server's user.
