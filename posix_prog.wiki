not complex, but so useful!

== ioctl ==

== stream buffering operations ==
=== strvbuf ===
change opend stream's buffer mode
* unbuffered
* line buffered
* fully buffered (block buffered?)

=== termios & ... ===
==== termios struct ====
- tcflag_t c_ifflag         input mode
- tcflag_t c_offlag
- c_cfflag
- *c_lfflag*                local mode?

* ISIG      when INTR, QUIT, SUSP, DSUSP received, generate the corrspoding
signal.
* *ICANON*      enable canonical mode

==== Cannonical and noncannonical mode ====
Cannonical mode

input is made available line by line, input line is available when one of the
line delimiters is typed (NL, EOL, EOL2 or EOF at the start of line)

Except in the case of EOF, the line delimiters is included in the buffer
returned by *read*.

...


Noncannonical mode

input is available immediately (without the user having to type a
        line-delimiters char), no input processing is performed, and line
editing is disabled.

=== fn on termios ===
- tcgetattr
- tcsetattr

* TCSANOW       change occurs immediately
* TCSADRAIN     after all output written to fd has been trasmitted.
* TCSAFLUSH     after all output written to the object referred by fd has been
transmitted
