- minimal
- complete
- clear and simple semantics
- intuitive
- easy to memorize
- lead to readable code

WARNING: This is for C++.

== Pointer vs. References ==
Yes, references is better as "safer and nicer".
But use Pointer for API will notify user it may changed in the function.

Comment::
Seems not big deal, as we have `const`.

== Passing by const-ref vs. Passing by value ==
If type is bigger than 16 bytes, pass by const-ref.

If type have a non-trivial copy-constructor or a non-trivial destructor, pass by
const-ref to avoid these methods.

All other types, should usually be passed by value.
