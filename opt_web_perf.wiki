== Critical Rendering Path ==

=== Construct Object Model ===

==== DOM ====
bytes -> char -> tokens -> nodes -> DOM

==== CSSOM ====
bytes -> char -> tokens -> nodes -> CSSOM

parse to get CSS.

And browser will seting "User-Agent style", and we will overwrite CSS to
default style.

=== Render-tree construct, Layout, and Paint ===
Render-tree is combined DOM and CSSOM.

NOTE:
- `visibility: hidden`   occur in render-tree, but only display a blank block.
- `display: none`       NOT occur in render-tree.

*box-model*

=== Rendering block CSS ===
link to css could have attrbute *media*
- print                 only need when print it
- (min-width: 40em)     only need when width greater than 40em
- landscape / portrait  orientation

other method is: *@media*, *@import*, prefer first TWO method.
avoid use @import style.

==== Responable Design ====
NOTE:
this attribute show how to implement *Responable Design*
# media, to adapt different size screen.
# relative size such as 70%

NOTE:
device-width, or device-XXX will return size of device's screen, not size of
browser's region.
